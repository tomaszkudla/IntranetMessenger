Web service for communication within office

Application was mainly done for learning purposes.    
It uses ASP .NET MVC, MS SQL Database and Entity Framework.   

Database on the server has tables for users and messages.  
New user has to register (users table record is added), then he can send messages to other users.   
Each message, with sender, reciever and send time, is added to the messages table.  
Logged user has only access to own send/recieved messages.
